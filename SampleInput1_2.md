Here are three sample inputs and outputs for the provided code that compares multiple approximate values to the true value and determines the best approximation based on the smallest absolute error.

### **Example 1**

#### Sample Input:
```
Enter the true value: 10.0

Enter the first approximate value: 9.8
Enter the second approximate value: 10.1
Enter the third approximate value: 9.9
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Absolute error for approximation 1: 0.200000
Absolute error for approximation 2: 0.100000
Absolute error for approximation 3: 0.100000

Best approximation is: 10.10
```

### **Example 2**

#### Sample Input:
```
Enter the true value: 25.0

Enter the first approximate value: 24.5
Enter the second approximate value: 25.3
Enter the third approximate value: 24.9
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Absolute error for approximation 1: 0.500000
Absolute error for approximation 2: 0.300000
Absolute error for approximation 3: 0.100000

Best approximation is: 24.90
```

### **Example 3**

#### Sample Input:
```
Enter the true value: 50.0

Enter the first approximate value: 49.5
Enter the second approximate value: 50.2
Enter the third approximate value: 50.0
```

#### Sample Output:
```
Absolute error for approximation 1: 0.500000
Absolute error for approximation 2: 0.200000
Absolute error for approximation 3: 0.000000

Best approximation is: 50.00
```

These examples demonstrate how the code evaluates different approximations and selects the one with the smallest absolute error as the best approximation.
